# 2nd level: Sandbox landing zones

This management group contains subscriptions for sandboxes. Sandboxes are meant as a totally free environment, nearing unrestricted. There are still a few restrictions, but not as strict as the other landing zones. DevOps teams are free to test and develop anything they need in this management group. You would still want some restrictions e.g. location deployment (only norwayeast/westeurope/northeurope), cost control (restrict VM SKUs), among others.
