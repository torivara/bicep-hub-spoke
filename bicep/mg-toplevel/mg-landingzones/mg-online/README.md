# 2nd level: Online landing zones

This management group contains subscriptions for online landing zones. Online landing zones are meant as a more free environment, but not unrestricted. There are still restrictions, but not as strict as corp landing zones. DevOps teams might be more free to perform drastic changes in their subscriptions here.
